# üî• FIRE!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub><sup>([Code](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/userscripts/blob/master/fire/fire.user.js)) &nbsp;([Install](https://github.com/Charcoal-SE/userscripts/raw/master/fire/fire.user.js))</sup></sub>

Feedback Instantly, Effortlessly, and Rapidly (FIRE)
is a userscript which allows you to react to SmokeDetector spam reports in chat
without leaving the chat room.

This is still a "work in progress".

As of this moment, the userscript posts flags _and_ MS feedback.

---

## Features
- Open a popup for any SmokeDetector report by clicking the "Fire" or "üî•" button in the report.
  ![Fire icon on report](fire.png)
- SmokeDetector's _last_ report can be opened in a popup using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd>
- The popup will contain:
  - A header for the post's site
    - Clicking this header or pressing <kbd>7</kbd> will open the reported post on the site.
  - A "Close" button.
  - 6 feedback buttons.
    - `[spam]`, `[rude]`, `[tpu-]`, `[tp-]`, `[naa-]`, `[fp-]`, for spam (with flag), rude/abusive (with flag), tpu- feedback without flag, vandalism, NAA/VLQ, false positive.
    - These can be selected with <kbd>1</kbd> through <kbd>6</kbd>, then "clicked" by pressing <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
    - The buttons can contain a number in parentheses. This indicates how many users have sent that type of feedback. All of `[spam]`, `[rude]`, and `[tpu-]` are the same feedback and will show the same number. They differ in what flag was raised, if any, but flag counts are not displayed.
  - The title for the reported question, or the title of the question on which the reported answer was placed.
    - Hovering over the title will display why the post was reported.
    - To the left of the title:
      - A ‚úèÔ∏è is displayed if the post has more than one revision (i.e. it has been edited, but not including edits made during the edit grace period).
<!--      - A üè≥Ô∏è is displayed if you have manually flagged the post.-->
<!--      - A üè¥ is displayed if you have auto-flagged the post.-->
  - The username of the post author and their reputation on that site.
  - The reported post's contents.
    - All links in a post will show a tooltip with their target URL when you hover your mouse over them. This is in addition to the browser's default display of hovered URLs.
    - Code blocks in the post can be expanded by clicking on them.
    - If selected (configurable setting), the post's images are hidden behind a placeholder image that can be clicked to show the image included in the post. If this option is set, then the post's images are not downloaded from their source until you click on the placeholder. This is to prevent potentially NSFW images from being downloaded to your machine.
  - At the bottom right of the popup, is a ‚öôÔ∏è, which opens the settings popup when clicked.
  - Just to the left of the ‚öôÔ∏è is the currently running version number of FIRE. It's a link to download the most recent released version from GitHub.
- Provided you [have authorized metasmoke](https://metasmoke.erwaysoftware.com/authentication/status) to cast flags from your account _and_ the configuration setting for flagging is enabled:
  - When you submit `spam` feedback, the post will _also_ be flagged as "spam" on the SE network.
  - When you submit `rude` feedback, the post will _also_ be flagged as "rude/abusive" on the SE network.
  - Those buttons will still work for providing feedback when the configureation setting for flagging is disabled.
- The popup modal's blur can be toggled with <kbd>B</kbd>
- The popup can be closed by pressing <kbd>Esc</kbd>, clicking outside of the popup, or clicking the `[Close]` button at the top-right of the popup.

### Examples

When SmokeDetector reports a post, these steps can be taken:

To flag it as spam and send _"True positive"_ feedback (_tpu-_):

1. <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> - Open the last report,
2. <kbd>1</kbd> - Select _"spam"_,
3. <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> - Submit.

To send _"False positive"_ feedback:

1. <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> - Open the last report,
2. <kbd>6</kbd> - Select _"fp-"_ (False positive),
3. <kbd>Space</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> - Submit.

To open the reported post on its site:

1. <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd> - Open the last report,
2. <kbd>7</kbd> - Open the post.

## Authorize FIRE with Stack Exchange

1. Open the settings window.
2. Click "Authorize" button.
3. A new window opens where you "accept"
4. That window redirects to this chat with an access token in the URL hash.
5. Fire sees the hash, saves your token, then closes the new window.
6. You go back to the old window, it detects a token, and shows you a "success" message.

You will need to do this from chat.stackexchange.com (chat.SE), commonly from [Charcoal HQ](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/11540/charcoal-hq).
Once you have chat.SE configured as you desire, you can manually transfer that configuration, including the tokens for authorizing with
Stack Exchange and metasmoke by:
1. In Charcoal HQ, enter the following into the browser console for the tab:

       (function(){var userData = localStorage['fire-user-data']; console.log(`(function(){localStorage['fire-user-data'] = '${userData}';})()`);})()
2. Copy the entirety of the output from that command and paste it into the browser console for a tab in chat.stackoverflow.com (chat.SO)
(e.g. [SOCVR](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/41570/so-close-vote-reviewers)). Then reload all tabs on chat.SO that are using FIRE.
This will overwrite the FIRE settings on chat.SO with the FIRE settings on chat.SE. If you also paste the same console output into a tab on
chat.meta.stackexchange.com, you'll have the same FIRE settings on all three chat servers.

## Loading from a bookmarklet (e.g. on mobile)

It is possible to load FIRE and AIM into the page using a bookmarklet. You can use the following code to load both
FIRE and AIM into a chat page using a bookmarklet or just by running the following in the browser console:

    javascript:void(function(){
      $.getScript( 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/joewalnes/reconnecting-websocket@5c66a7b0e436815c25b79c5579c6be16a6fd76d2/reconnecting-websocket.js' )
        .then(() => $.getScript( 'https://charcoal-se.org/userscripts/vendor/debug.min.js' ))
        .then(() => $.getScript( 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Charcoal-SE/Userscripts/autoflagging/autoflagging.user.js'))
        .then(() => {
          window.GM_info = {
            script: {
              version: '5.0.20',
              downloadURL: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Charcoal-SE/Userscripts/master/fire/fire.user.js',
            },
          };
          $.getScript( 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Charcoal-SE/Userscripts/fire/fire.user.js' );
        });
    })();

## Common Failures

 - When you first install FIRE, you probably have to reload the chat room before you see the clickable üî• FIRE decorations
 - Forgetting to authorize FIRE. See the previous section.
 - FIRE will not submit flags on any site where you are a diamond moderator (‚ô¶), as a security precaution. However, it will still flag on all other sites. Your feedback will still be submitted on sites you are a moderator. The restriction of not raising flags on sites where you are a moderator is a general flagging-through-metasmoke restriction.  
 - Flagging will fail if you are not registered on the particular site.
